<h1> 1. Movie Ranking Project</h1>

<h1>The Best Movies According to Miguel</h1>

<h1> My First Top 3 Movies </h1>

<hr/>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> I love watching movies, especially adventure and science fiction. However, I chose the one with moral lessons that can apply in our lives. </p>

<h2> My first top 3 movies are: </h2>

<h3> 1. Avengers </h3>
<p> The heroes worked together to save the planet from evil aliens. </p>

<h3> 2. Justice League </h3>
<p> They stopped Stephenwolf from forming the 3 mother boxes into the Unity that can destroy the world. </p>

<h3> 3. In Time</h3>
<p> In the end, Will and Sylvia fight the Timekeepers, win the battle, get one million years for the poor and dying people, and save them. </p>

<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p> These Movies talk about helping each other, not losing hope and giving up. We should enjoy the graces, time, and life we have. Use our time wisely and take care of ourselves and other people as much as we can. </p>
